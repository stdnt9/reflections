When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You want to create a remote repository when you need to work on different devices or together with different people so every device or contributor always has the latest version.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You want to pull changes manually, so you can push all commits that belong to one new function or feature together, rather then push every single commit, leting your remote in an nonconsistant or notworking state til you pushed every commit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
You would use forks to make changes to repositorys you don't have the right to push to. Clone to get an online repository to your local machine. And branches to create a "fork" on your local machine.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can compare the last changes of the remote with your own status or changes and prepare how to solve conflicts, even offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without Git or GitHub i would probably only collaborate offline, with friends or colleagues i meet regularly.
This would make it easier to understand their changes, because they could directly explain them to me. But it would be much harder to keep everybody up to date and find dates to meet each other to exchange our code.
