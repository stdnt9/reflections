What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository you create a hidden .git folder where metadata about tracked files and their changes are stored. Without initializing you couldn't create commits or use any versioncontrol features of git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is some kind of buffer between your working directory and your repository. It helps you to keep your commits to single logical steps, even if you changed more things during the same time.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can add only the files that were changed during one logical change to the stating area to commit them, without commiting other changes, that had no logical connection.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches are helpful in situations where you add experimental features, that you are not sure about if they work out, or if you make an version in a different language or on a different platform.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
They help you visualize wich other commits are reachable from any commit and wich are not. Also you get to see faster what are the parent commits.
